								<p>Mostly I'm data structures and algorithmic guy. I love when I get stuck by solving the hard problems because when I solve it, it makes me feel good. Keep in mind put your more efforts to understand what is the problem rather than how to solve it because once you got the problem statement only then you can proceed to solve it.</p>
								<p>I learn new things which means things which are unknown to me, sometimes learning new things takes much more time but when you got familier with it then we realize it value (I'm talking about technical things). Let me give you an example I'm using docker container in my one project, I was very noob in that and when I started to learn it I struggled so much but as I said when you will familier with it you will realize its values.</p>
								<p>My favourite quotes is "The softest pencil is always better than the sharpest memory."</p>

						<!-- Work -->

								<h2 class="major">Work</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/work1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I am student, still I'm not working for any organization. Contributing to my project I call itself my work.</p>
								<p>I always think work is nothing but updating youself from the your past one. Always remember "Your work is not job, its your craft". No matter from what field you are just keep learning and updating yourself because "The person who learns the most grows the quickest wins".</p>

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I always prefer less talk. I'm a foodie. In spare time sometimes I read books and sometimes I go around and sometimes the favourite one I take sleep, funny isn't it? I focus on the things which makes me happy rather than the things which I don't have. No matter what happens I keep saying that "Everythings is happens for a good reason" it doesn't implies that you are not doing anything still hoping for the best results.</p>
								<p>There is good times and bad times, But whose to says that the bad times aren't great times. I always travel the journey without destinations because a destination makes you to stop once you reached.</p>
